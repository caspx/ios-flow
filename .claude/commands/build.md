# Build for Simulator

Build the app targeting the iOS Simulator.

## Steps

1. Use `xcodebuildmcp_build` to build the app for the iOS Simulator
2. If the build **succeeds**, report success with a brief summary
3. If the build **fails**:
   - Read the error messages carefully
   - Identify the root cause
   - Suggest specific fixes with code snippets
   - If the fix is straightforward, apply it and rebuild automatically
